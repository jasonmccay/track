# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Event Tracking System is a manual event logging application that allows users to capture, organize, and search through events as they occur. The system supports multiple event types (messages, photos, emails, texts, documents), user assignments, tagging for organization, and provides timeline visualization with comprehensive search capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manually create events with timestamps, so that I can track when things happen in chronological order.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new event THEN the system SHALL automatically assign the current timestamp
2. WHEN a user creates a new event THEN the system SHALL allow manual timestamp adjustment
3. WHEN a user creates an event THEN the system SHALL record the creating user as the event owner
4. WHEN an event is created THEN the system SHALL ensure the timestamp is stored in a consistent format

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to assign multiple users to events, so that I can track who is involved or responsible for each event.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating an event THEN the system SHALL allow assignment of zero or more additional users
2. WHEN viewing an event THEN the system SHALL display the creator and all assigned users
3. WHEN a user is assigned to an event THEN the system SHALL validate the user exists
4. WHEN removing a user assignment THEN the system SHALL maintain event integrity

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to categorize events with tags, so that I can organize and group related events together.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating an event THEN the system SHALL allow adding multiple tags
2. WHEN adding tags THEN the system SHALL support both existing and new tag creation
3. WHEN displaying events THEN the system SHALL show all associated tags
4. WHEN managing tags THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate tags on the same event

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to specify different event types, so that I can distinguish between messages, photos, emails, texts, and documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating an event THEN the system SHALL require selection of an event type
2. WHEN the event type is "photo with notes" THEN the system SHALL allow image upload and text notes
3. WHEN the event type is "email" THEN the system SHALL capture email-specific metadata
4. WHEN the event type is "document" THEN the system SHALL support file attachment
5. WHEN the event type is "simple message" or "text" THEN the system SHALL provide text input fields

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view events in a timeline format, so that I can see the chronological flow of events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the timeline THEN the system SHALL display events in chronological order
2. WHEN viewing the timeline THEN the system SHALL show event type, timestamp, creator, and summary
3. WHEN viewing the timeline THEN the system SHALL support both ascending and descending chronological order
4. WHEN the timeline has many events THEN the system SHALL implement pagination or infinite scroll

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search events by various criteria, so that I can quickly find specific events or groups of events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN searching THEN the system SHALL support filtering by date ranges
2. WHEN searching THEN the system SHALL support filtering by tags
3. WHEN searching THEN the system SHALL support keyword search in event content
4. WHEN searching THEN the system SHALL support filtering by assigned users
5. WHEN searching THEN the system SHALL support filtering by event type
6. WHEN searching THEN the system SHALL support combining multiple search criteria
7. WHEN search results are displayed THEN the system SHALL highlight matching terms

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view detailed information about individual events, so that I can see all associated data and metadata.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing an event detail THEN the system SHALL display all event information
2. WHEN viewing an event detail THEN the system SHALL show creation timestamp and creator
3. WHEN viewing an event detail THEN the system SHALL display all assigned users and tags
4. WHEN viewing an event detail THEN the system SHALL show type-specific content appropriately
5. WHEN viewing attached files THEN the system SHALL provide download or preview capabilities

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to edit existing events, so that I can correct mistakes or add additional information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN editing an event THEN the system SHALL allow modification of all editable fields
2. WHEN editing an event THEN the system SHALL preserve the original creation timestamp and creator
3. WHEN editing an event THEN the system SHALL track modification history
4. WHEN saving edits THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields are present
5. IF a user is not the creator THEN the system SHALL check edit permissions
